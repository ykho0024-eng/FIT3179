                                <p><strong>2008-2013: Significant Improvement</strong><br>
                                From 2008 to 2013, offence rates fell quite noticeably. This positive trend could be attributed to improved policing strategies, new legislation, or broader social improvements that contributed to enhanced community safety.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>2013-2019: Relative Stability</strong><br>
                                Between 2013 and 2019, offence levels remained fairly steady with only minor fluctuations, suggesting a period of consolidation in personal safety measures.</p>

                            <p><strong>Post-2019: Concerning Increase</strong><br>
                            After 2019, offences rose sharply, reaching peak levels by 2023-2024. This significant jump could be linked to post-COVID societal impacts, population growth dynamics, or changes in reporting practices and legislation.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The population-adjusted rate follows almost the same trendline as total cases, indicating that changes reflect real behavioral shifts rather than being purely population-driven.

                                <p><strong>Northern Territory: Persistent Crisis</strong><br>
                                The Northern Territory consistently shows the highest offence rates, far exceeding national baselines. Rates surpass 450 per 10,000 people in recent years, indicating deep-seated structural challenges requiring targeted interventions.</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Queensland: Data Reporting Change</strong><br>
                                The apparent sharp rise in Queensland's recorded offence rate between 2022 and 2024 does not indicate an actual crime surge. Instead, it reflects a data availability change, as assault data for Queensland was not published until 2022. Earlier figures therefore significantly under-represented total offences.</p>

                            Western Australia shows concerning continuous growth, with offence rates almost doubling over 25 years to reach 173 per 10,000 in 2024. This trend suggests systemic issues that have developed over the long term.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Australian Capital Territory: Improvement Story</strong><br>
                            The ACT stands out as one of the few improving regions, with crime rates peaking around 2007 then decreasing steadily to settle at lower levels by 2024.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Victoria: Consistent Performance</strong><br>
                            Victoria remains the lowest-risk state, with relatively minor fluctuations and stable long-term performance, suggesting effective ongoing safety measures.</p>

                            Assault consistently makes up the vast majority of recorded offences, accounting for over 70-80% of all cases across the entire timeline.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Historical Trends</strong><br>
                            From the mid-1990s to mid-2000s, total offences steadily increased, driven mostly by assault growth. A notable dip around 2008-2012 suggests improvements in prevention and reporting systems.</p>

                <p><strong>Sexual Assault: Rising Awareness</strong><br>
                While much smaller than assault, sexual assault numbers have clearly risen over time, especially after 2015. This likely indicates greater reporting confidence and societal awareness rather than necessarily more incidents.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Recent Developments</strong><br>
                After 2013, levels remained relatively stable before a sharp increase post-2020, likely tied to post-pandemic effects or reporting changes.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Serious but Rare Crimes</strong><br>
                Homicide and kidnapping/abduction remain consistently tiny proportions of total offences, though their serious nature demands continued attention.</p>

                <p><strong>Key Demographic Insights:</strong></p>
                
                <p><strong>1. Young People at Highest Sexual Assault Risk</strong><br>
                Females aged 10-17 have the highest number of sexual assault cases (12,109)â€”more than any other age or gender group. Crime prevention and support efforts clearly need to prioritize teenagers, particularly adolescent girls.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Assault Peaks in Early Adulthood</strong><br>
                For both males and females, assault cases rise sharply from 18 to 44 years, reaching highest levels between 25-34 years. This suggests adults in their working and parenting years face the most physical violence.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Robbery as Youth Crime</strong><br>
                Robbery peaks in teenagers (10-17 years) for both genders, indicating offending or victimization is strongly linked to adolescence. Numbers drop steadily with age.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Total Burden on Young Women</strong><br>
                Females aged 18-34 record a total of 64,132 offences compared to 42,484 for males in the same range, suggesting women in early adulthood face high vulnerability across multiple offence categories.</p>

                            The data reveals a clear divide between private and public crime environments, suggesting the need for different prevention strategies: domestic safety interventions for homes, and situational crime prevention for public spaces.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Domestic Settings Dominate Violent Crime</strong><br>
                Assault and sexual assault are overwhelmingly concentrated in dwellings (homes or residential settings), suggesting personal violence is more likely to occur in domestic or familiar environments rather than public spaces.</p>
                
                <p><strong>2. Robbery Linked to Public Spaces</strong><br>
                Street/footpath, transport, and retail locations show high robbery counts, reflecting opportunistic or confrontational robberies occurring in transit and commercial areas.</p>
                
                <p><strong>3. Moderate Risk in Community Spaces</strong><br>
                Parks, social venues, and other public community locations show mid-range levels of assault and sexual assault, indicating risks in nightlife and social gathering environments.</p>
                
                <p><strong>4. Transport and Retail Hotspots</strong><br>
                Robbery and assault spike in transport hubs and retail/commercial environments, pointing to the need for security measures in public-facing areas.</p>

                                <p><strong>Weapon-Free Violence Dominates</strong><br>
                                Most violent crimes in Australia are committed without formal weapons, relying on physical force or intimidation instead. This pattern is particularly strong in assault (91% no weapon) and sexual assault (99% no weapon).</p>
                                
                                <p><strong>Robbery: The Weapon-Dependent Crime</strong><br>
                                Robbery stands out as the most weapon-driven offence, with 45% of cases involving weapons. This reflects the intimidation requirements of this crime type.</p>

                            <p><strong>1. Knives: Most Common Weapon</strong><br>
                            Knives consistently appear as the leading weapon across violent offences, especially in robbery (27%) and homicide (25%), followed by blunt objects in assault-related crimes.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>2. Sexual Assault: Rarely Weaponized</strong><br>
                            Virtually all sexual assault cases (99%) involve no weapon, suggesting offenders rely more on coercion, manipulation, or power imbalance rather than physical tools.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>3. Homicide: Greatest Weapon Variety</strong><br>
                            Homicide shows the most diverse weapon use, with knives (25%) and firearms (12%) far more common than in other offences. Interestingly, nearly half (44%) still occur without weapons.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>4. Firearms: Relatively Rare</strong><br>
                            Firearms remain relatively uncommon across all offence types, appearing most frequently in homicide (12%) but playing minor roles in other crimes.</p>
